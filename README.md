# About This Project

## Description

This Nurses Application is a JavaScript application built with a React Framework and styled with Semantic-UI that takes a list of the most commonly found Nurses and their average salary in the USA.
In the list of Nurses each Nurse has a like button that is clickable, when the like button is clicked it will increase the like count by 1. There is a new Nurse button on the nurses page that when clicked it will generate a form where you can input the nurses name and the average salary and it will start off with a like count of 0 and it will be added to the the end of the nurses list. a
